->Stream - flow of data
->Buffer - a temporary storage for a stream of data
->example: youtube video buffering. data will be stored in the buffer and that data will be slowly consumed.


->In java, There are two streams
    - Byte stream (occupies 1byte)
        |_Input stream 
        |_ouput_stream

    - CharacterStream  (occupies 2bytes)
        |_Reader
        |_Writer

->Byte Stream(InputStream methods) methods :
    * read() - reads character by character
    * read(byte[] b) - reads as a byte array based on it's size
    * read(byte[] b, offset, length) - offset - index for a starting position, length - length to be read
    * available() - returns an int of the length of the stream
    * skips() - used to skip the bytes while reading
    * mark(limit l) - only applicable for buffered streams. Mark marks a byte. reset() method is used to traverse between the current position
    and the marked position. If the control goes beyond the limit, the mark will be destroyed
    *  markSupported()  - Used to verify the stream is buffered
    * close() - to close the connection.

->Byte stream(OutputStream methods) methods:
    * write() - writes character by character
    * write(byte[] b) - writes as a byte array based on it's size
    * write(byte[] b, offset, length) - offset - index for a starting position, length - length to be read
    *flush() - forcing to write the data from buffer/output stream to external source
    *close() - To close the connection
